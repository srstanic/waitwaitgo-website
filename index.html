                <p>It's primarily used for timing rest periods during a strength training workout. Let your phone notify you when it's time to start the next set or exercise.</p>

                <p>Saves battery. Works in the background and with the screen locked.</p>
                <p>A gentle sound warning signals you to start preparing for the next set. Another more distinct sound follows when the time is up.</p>
                <p>Uses carefully selected custom sounds that play nice with your workout music. Noticeable enough not to miss them, but still easy on your ears.</p>

                <h3>Still, did we really need another timer app?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Before making this app, I downloaded and tried 12 different timer apps on my iPhone. And each one of them was missing something from the list of features above. So I made an app that has it all. It requires as little attention as possible during my workout and it helps me focus on my rest. I hope that it will do the same for you!</p>
                <h3>Try it out, it's completely FREE!</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="text-dim">It's available on the App Store and you can download it by clicking this button from your iOS device.</span>
                    <br/>Coming soon!

                <h3>Suggestions for improvements?</h3>
                <p>WaitWaitGo! makes my workouts better almost daily. Since I use it so much, I have some ideas how to improve it, but I’d also love to hear your feedback!
